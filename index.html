			<h1>Hi, I'm Raphaël 😎</h1>

			<h2 class="title-bold">Travel ✈️</h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about travel. Travelling is clearly my favorite thing to do. I love discovering new places and, above all, different cultures. I've been lucky enough to go on language stays in Malta and the United States, and it really opened my eyes to lifestyles I didn't know at all. My parents and I have visited a lot of countries in Europe and elsewhere, and each time it's a new adventure. It's as if each trip adds a new dimension to the way I see the world.

			<h2 class="title-bold">Cook 👨🏻‍🍳</h2>
			<p>
				Cooking is a real passion for me. I love exploring recipes, playing with flavors and seeing how each ingredient can transform a dish. My internship at Dessirier, in the 17th arrondissement of Paris, was an incredible experience: I discovered the exacting standards and creativity required in a professional kitchen.

			<h2 class="title-bold">Boxing 🥊</h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about boxing. Boxing became more than just a sport for me. I took lessons for three years, and it really taught me to push myself. Between the intense physical training and the discipline it demands, I discovered a real way of channelling my energy. Boxing gave me self-confidence and taught me to never give up, whether in the ring or in life.
